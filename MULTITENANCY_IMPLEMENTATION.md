# Multitenancy Implementation for Cases Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of multitenancy for the cases feature in the Law Firm SaaS application. All Supabase queries have been updated to include user isolation through `user_id` filtering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `add-user-id-to-cases.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `user_id` column to all relevant tables: `clients`, `cases`, `documents`, `billing`, `calendar_events`
  - Created indexes for better performance on `user_id` columns
  - Updated Row Level Security (RLS) policies to filter by `user_id`
  - Replaced generic "authenticated users" policies with user-specific policies

### 2. Cases Page Updates
- **File**: `src/app/cases/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `useAuth` import and session access
  - Updated `loadClients()` to filter by `user_id`
  - Updated `loadCases()` to filter by `user_id` and join with clients
  - Updated insert queries to include `user_id: session.user.id`
  - Updated update queries to restrict by both `id` and `user_id`
  - Updated delete queries to restrict by both `id` and `user_id`
  - Added session validation with error handling

### 3. Case Detail Page Updates
- **File**: `src/app/cases/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `useAuth` import and session access
  - Updated case loading query to filter by `user_id`
  - Added session validation with error handling

## Key Implementation Details

### Insert Operations
```typescript
// Before
.insert([{ title, notes, status, client_id }])

// After
.insert([{ title, notes, status, client_id, user_id: session.user.id }])
```

### Select Operations
```typescript
// Before
.select('*, clients(name)')

// After
.select('id, title, status, notes, created_at, clients(name)')
.eq('user_id', session.user.id)
```

### Update/Delete Operations
```typescript
// Before
.eq('id', caseId)

// After
.eq('id', caseId)
.eq('user_id', session.user.id)
```

### Client Name Display
The cases listing now properly displays client names as "Povezani klijent" through the joined `clients(name)` relationship.

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to your Supabase database:

1. Run the SQL script `add-user-id-to-cases.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. The script will:
   - Add `user_id` columns to all tables
   - Create necessary indexes
   - Update RLS policies for proper user isolation
   - Preserve existing data (existing records without `user_id` will be filtered out for new users)

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
2. **Row Level Security**: Database-level protection against unauthorized access
3. **Session Validation**: Application-level checks for user authentication
4. **Consistent Filtering**: All queries consistently filter by `user_id`

## Notes

- Existing records without `user_id` will not be visible to new users
- If you need to migrate existing data, uncomment and modify the UPDATE statements in the SQL script
- The implementation follows the principle of least privilege - users can only access their own data
- All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are properly secured with user isolation

## Testing

After implementing these changes:
1. Create a new user account
2. Verify that the new user sees an empty cases list
3. Create a new case and verify it's associated with the correct user
4. Verify that users cannot access each other's data
5. Test all CRUD operations to ensure proper user isolation
