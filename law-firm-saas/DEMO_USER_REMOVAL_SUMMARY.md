# Demo User Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete removal of the demo user logic from the Odvjetnikai project, replacing it with a 7-day free trial system for all new users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migrations

**New Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250113_remove_demo_user_and_cleanup.sql`

- **Removed demo user** from `auth.users` and `public.profiles` tables
- **Cleaned up RLS policies** by removing demo-specific read-only policies
- **Updated `handle_new_user()` function** to create users with trial status instead of active subscription
- **Added trial fields** to profiles table (`trial_start_date`, `trial_end_date`)
- **Updated `user_has_active_subscription()` function** to include trial users with valid trial periods

### 2. Frontend Changes

**Login Screen** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`):
- ✅ Removed demo credentials banner completely
- ✅ Removed hardcoded demo user exception in login logic
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports (`Copy`, `Check` icons)
- ✅ Removed unused state variables (`copiedField`, `setCopiedField`)
- ✅ Removed unused `copyToClipboard` function

**Subscription Guard** (`src/components/auth/SubscriptionGuard.tsx`):
- ✅ Removed demo user exception from subscription check
- ✅ Now all users must have active subscription or valid trial to access the app

### 3. API Changes

**Test Route** (`src/app/api/subscription/test/route.ts`):
- ✅ Already worked with any email (no changes needed)
- ✅ No hardcoded demo user references found

### 4. Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- ✅ Updated authentication section to mention 7-day free trial
- ✅ Removed references to demo account
- ✅ Added information about trial limits (20 items)

### 5. File Cleanup

**Removed Files**:
- ✅ `DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - No longer needed
- ✅ `run-database-fix.js` - Demo user testing script
- ✅ `apply-subscription-fix.js` - Demo user fix script
- ✅ `test_migration_validation.sql` - Demo user validation script

## New User Flow

### Before (Demo User System)
1. Users could login with `demo@odvjetnikai.com` / `Demo123!`
2. Demo user had read-only access to all data
3. Regular users needed active subscription

### After (7-Day Trial System)
1. **New users** automatically get 7-day trial on registration
2. **Trial users** have full access to all features (limit 20 items)
3. **After trial expires**, users must subscribe to continue
4. **No demo account** - all users must register

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields in `profiles` Table
```sql
trial_start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
trial_end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

### Updated Functions
- `handle_new_user()`: Creates users with `subscription_status = 'trial'`
- `user_has_active_subscription()`: Returns true for active subscriptions OR valid trials

## Migration Instructions

### To Apply Changes

1. **Run the new migration** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of:
   -- supabase/migrations/20250113_remove_demo_user_and_cleanup.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the changes**:
   ```sql
   -- Check that demo user is removed
   SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo@odvjetnikai.com';
   SELECT * FROM public.profiles WHERE email = 'demo@odvjetnikai.com';
   
   -- Check that trial fields exist
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name LIKE 'trial_%';
   ```

3. **Test new user registration**:
   - Register a new user
   - Verify they get trial status
   - Verify they can access the app for 7 days

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Simplified User Experience**: No confusion about demo vs real accounts
2. **Better Conversion**: All users get to try the full product
3. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed demo-specific logic and exceptions
4. **Consistent Security**: All users follow the same authentication flow
5. **Better Analytics**: All users are real users, not demo accounts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user registration creates trial account
- [ ] Trial users can access all features (with 20-item limit)
- [ ] Trial users are redirected to pricing after 7 days
- [ ] Active subscribers can access all features
- [ ] No demo user references in frontend code
- [ ] Login screen shows clean form without demo credentials
- [ ] All RLS policies work correctly for trial users

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the demo user can be restored by:
1. Reverting the migration files
2. Re-adding the demo user creation code
3. Restoring the demo-specific RLS policies
4. Re-adding the demo credentials banner to login screen

However, this is not recommended as the trial system provides a better user experience.
